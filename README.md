# hello-world
This is my first repository!

So, I'm starting my journey to become a software developer! For as long as I can rememeber I have been obsessed with computers. Whether it was hardware, software, games... you name it - I've been tearing apart, building, altering, fixing, changing anything and everything.

At 16, fresh out of high school I enrolled in my college course (I'm British, we go to "college" at 16) software development. I had high aspirations, a path, a vision; but I didn't really understand what challenges lay ahead.

I dropped out of my course after just 2 months! I really wasn't in the correct frame of mind to take on such a challenge, such a commitment. Having ADHD I struggled through much of my education, I had just left my special-education boarding school far from being prepared. Being thrown in the deepend, learning C++ was just to much...  

I digress, I re-enrolled in Sports Development the following year and took the "back-up" plan. 6 years later, all I can think about is, "why didn't I stick to what I'm good at? Why didn't anyone encourage me to bite the bullet and work hard at the challenge? I know this is was I was meant to do!". So here we are.
